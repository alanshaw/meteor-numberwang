meteor-numberwang
=================

The meteor website is basically broadcasting what is going on in the game. Johnny Five is orchestrating the real world, where there are two players and a numberwang master. The two players mash their buzzers incrementing their counts. Meanwhile their respective LEDs are counting their progress in binary. The numberwang master at some random point presses his button and the player with the highest count wins the round. THATS NUMBERWANG!
